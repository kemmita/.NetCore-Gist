1. The below column would have been declared as nvarcharMAX, and we do not need that much so we use column and Typename to rename the datatype.

```cs 
    public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser
    {
        [Column(TypeName = ("nvarchar(150)"))]
        public string FullName { get; set; }
    }
```
