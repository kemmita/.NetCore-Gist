1. Make sure that npm is installed and that angulais installed globally 
2. This part is important, we will have our .net core app and our Angular app next to eachother so instead of adding angular to
 /c/Demo/DatingApp/DatingApp.API, we will want to add it to  /c/Demo/DatingApp this way they will be installed next to eachother
 then run in the correct file path  ng new DatingApp.SPA

3. then in bash go to directory /c/Demo/DatingApp then run code .
this will ensure that both the frontend and abckend open up side by side in vs code
