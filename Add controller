1.We want to add a Books controller so add that file to the controllers folder
2.then go to the views folder and add a folder with the same name as the controller so in our case Books
//in this folder is where all the views will go that are realted to the Books Controller

3. Then we need to establish a connection to our database 
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using BookList.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace BookList.Controllers
{
    public class BooksController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _db;

        public BooksController(ApplicationDbContext db)
        {
            _db = db;

        }
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View(_db.Books.ToList());
        }



        //at the end of our controller, we always want to dispose of our db object
        protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                _db.Dispose();
            }
        }
    }
}
