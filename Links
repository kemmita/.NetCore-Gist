**Better Way To Do It***
//the whole link wll depend on the .NET helper tag and that the controller and action specified exist
view
<li><a asp-area="" asp-controller="Books" asp-action="Index">Books</a></li>
//in order for the link to work above we will need a controller call BooksController and a IActionReult called Index
controller
//they both exist so the link will work
public class BooksController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _db;

        public BooksController(ApplicationDbContext db)
        {
            _db = db;

        }
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View(_db.Books.ToList());
        }










1. if we want to redirect a user with a link in .NET we can use asp-action but it must be linking out to a page that is within
the same controller from which we are currently using

2.so here is the BooksController we have an Iactionresult for index and create
 public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View(_db.Books.ToList());
        }

        public IActionResult Create()
        {
            return View();
        }
3. here is the view for index
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Index";
}

<br /> 
<h2>Book List</h2>
<hr />
<p>
//here we link to our create view and we can do this without a route because they both belong to thew same controller
    <a asp-action="Create" class="btn btn-primary">Add</a>
</p>
