1. when we click on a name of a book, we want to be able to see its details
2. go to where the book title is and click the edit button
//below we are importing the data from the database without the code below, we could not grab the id of the book we want to view
model IEnumerable<BookList.Models.Book>
        @foreach (var item in Model)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                    @item.Name
                </td>
                <td>
                //when this button is clicked the id of the book will be grabbed usuing asp-route-id="@item.Id"
                //the id will then be routed to the asp-action in our controller we declared below details
                    <a asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@item.Id" class="btn btn-sm btn-success">Edit</a>
                       </td>
            </tr> 
        }

//now in the controller, we go to our details action and pass in a id
      public async Task<IActionResult> Details(int? id)
        {
            if (id == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            //the var book below will find the book in the database and then take on its value
            var book = await _db.Books.SingleOrDefaultAsync(m => m.Id == id);
            if (book == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }
            //then the data will be transfered to the Details view
            return View(book);
        }
//Details View, we import the model and we can see that the book object from the controller above has made it here and the name will appear
