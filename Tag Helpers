1. Using the Tag helpers the code knows where to go for the controller and which action will be used in the controller. If we need to edit
something we can use the route-id so that the id of the data is passed to the action within the controloler.

<a asp-action="Edit" asp-controller="Home" asp-route-id="@item.Id">Edit</a>
