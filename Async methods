1. Being able to use Asynchronis programming is usefull when dealing with a lot of trafic
2. Below we use Async with our Index Action

        public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
        {
            return View(await _db.Categories.ToListAsync()); //we can use await in the return View method
        }
